Back-end PHP

Lou's Cellar is my first attempt at a php website. 
It is a database of wines (and eventually breweries?) local to Louisville, Kentucky. 
The goal of Version 1 is a listing of all wineries and individual wines. With an individual about page for each wine. Users can rate wines and those ratings will be averaged and viewable on the main page.

Using: PHP, MySql, HTML, CSS
